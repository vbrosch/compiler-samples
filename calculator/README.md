# calculator

A simple grammar implemented in bison and flex that can calculate rudimentary arithmetic expressions.
A more powerful implementation, which was very useful while creating this grammar, can be found here:
https://github.com/Package/Bison-Flex-Calculator/

e.g.
* 5+5*(10-2)
* (5-3)/(2/3)

Please install bison, flex and gcc before execution of make!

## Usage
```
  make && ./calc
```
